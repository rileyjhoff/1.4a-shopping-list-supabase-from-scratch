## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)

## Stretch Goal Ideas

1) Allow users to un-buy items they accidentally click.
2) Allow users to delete individual shopping list items by clicking on a button next to the list item.
3) Add checkboxes and a "bulk buy" button. Allow users to "buy" or "un-buy" multiple items with a single click.
4) Loading spinner!
5) Give shopping list items a due date, and tell the user how long they have to buy each item. If a shopping list item is past its due date, style it differently.
6) What if users could _see a list of other users_, and click on that user to see _that user's shopping list_? Hint: you cannot directly query the `user` table, so you will need to create a weird separate table called `shopping_list_users`, and add a row to it whenever you create a new user.

# Plan

![wireframes](/assets/wireframes.png)

## HTML

- hard coded:
  - section to hold everything
  - shopping list item form
    - either a dropdown or input for quantity
    - input for item name
    - submit button
  - div to render and append shopping list items
    - some default text like "add shopping list items to begin"
- dynamic:
  - shopping list item div
    - checkbox
    - div
      - quantity dropdown (which can edit the item in supabase)
      - delete item button or link (ideally can just be a link)
      - shopping list item in a p tag (editable)
      - buy/bought button
  - buy all button
    - only renders when an unbought item is checked
  - under all button
    - only renders when a bought item is checked
  - a delete all button (not in wireframes) - appended below the buy all/undo all buttons
    - user needs to confirm before deleting all

## Order

1. supabase CRUD functions
2. hard code HTML
3. write render function
4. write form event listener
    1. write fetchAndDisplayList function
5. write on load event listener
6. write bought/undo button event listener
7. write delete all button event listener
8. write quantity change event listener
9. write delete item event listener
10. write checkbox click event listener
    1. write buy all event listener
    2. write undo all event listener
11. write edit item name event listener
12. stretch goals
