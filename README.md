## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)

## Grading Rubric

| User should be able to . . .                                                         |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Visit the deployed pages on GitHub pages, with link in the About section of the Github repo |    1 |
| See bought items styled differently from unbought items                                   |        1 |

| Events                                                                                |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| On the home page (`'/'`), Login and Signup using the login and signup form. On success, redirect to the `/list` page   |        1 |
| Logout by clicking the logout button                                                       |       1 |
| If a non-logged-in user tries to visit the list page, redirect them to the login page     |       1 |
| On the list page load event, fetch the list itemss from supabase and render them to the page. Note that list items should have a quantity and an item name. Call your `fetchAndDisplayList()` function to do this work.        |        2 |
| Add a list item to supabase by using the input and button.                                     |        2 |
| When a list item is added, clear out the shopping list and render the updated list of shopping items.       |        2 |
| When a user clicks a list item, it becomes bought. Update this state in supabase, clear out the shopping list, and re-fetch and redisplay the updated items. Call your `fetchAndDisplayList()` function to do this work.                |        2 |
| When a user clicks delete all shopping list items, delete them. Update this state in supabase, clear out the shopping list, and re-fetch and redisplay the updated items. Call your `fetchAndDisplayList()` function to do this work.               |        1 |

| Functions                                                                                |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| ASYNC: `createItem(item)` : create a item in supabase for the logged-in user |1|
| ASYNC: `deleteAllItems()` : delete all items  in supabasefor the logged-in user |1|
| ASYNC: `getItems()` : get all items in supabase for the logged-in user |1|
| ASYNC: `buyItem(id)` : complete this items in supabase for the logged-in user |1|
| PURE: `renderItem(item)` : takes in an item object and returns a DOM element |1|
| IMPURE: `fetchAndDisplayList()` : fetchest the items, clears out the list, and redisplays them |1|

## Stretch Goal Ideas

1) Allow users to un-buy items they accidentally click.
2) Allow users to delete individual shopping list items by clicking on a button next to the list item.
3) Add checkboxes and a "bulk buy" button. Allow users to "buy" or "un-buy" multiple items with a single click.
4) Loading spinner!
5) Give shopping list items a due date, and tell the user how long they have to buy each item. If a shopping list item is past its due date, style it differently.
6) What if users could _see a list of other users_, and click on that user to see _that user's shopping list_? Hint: you cannot directly query the `user` table, so you will need to create a weird separate table called `shopping_list_users`, and add a row to it whenever you create a new user.
